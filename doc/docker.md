# Floresta Docker Setup Guide

You can find a [Dockerfile](../contrib/docker/Dockerfile) in the `contrib/docker` directory of the project, which you can use to build a
docker image for Floresta. We also keep the docker image [dlsz/floresta](https://hub.docker.com/r/dlsz/floresta)
on Docker Hub, which you can pull and run directly.

If you want to run using compose, you may use a simple `docker-compose.yml` file like this:

```yaml
services:
  floresta:
    image: dlsz/floresta:latest
    container_name: Floresta
    command: florestad -c /data/config.toml --data-dir /data/.floresta
    ports:
      - 50001:50001
      - 8332:8332
    volumes:
      - /path/config/floresta.toml:/data/config.toml
      - /path/utreexo:/data/.floresta
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Here's a breakdown of the configuration:
- For the command, there are a couple of options that are worth noticing:
  - `--data-dir /data/.floresta` specifies `florestad`'s data directory. Here, `florestad` will store its blockchain data, wallet files, and other necessary data.

  - `-c /data/config.toml` specifies the path to the configuration file inside the container. By default, Floresta looks for a configuration file at the datadir if no configuration file is specified.
  You should mount a volume to at each path to persist data outside the container.

  - `-n <network>` specifies the Bitcoin network to connect to (mainnet, testnet, testnet4, signet, regtest). Make sure this matches your configuration file.
- The `ports` section maps the container's ports to your host machine. Adjust these as necessary.
  - `50001` is used for Electrum server connections. It may change depending on the network you are using or your configuration.

  - `8332` is used for RPC connections. Adjust this if you have changed the RPC port in your configuration file.

This setup will run Floresta in a Docker container and expose the RPC and Electrum ports, so you can connect to them. After the container is running, you can connect to it using an Electrum wallet or any other compatible client.

To use the RPC via CLI, you can use a command like this:

```bash
docker exec -it Floresta floresta-cli getblockchaininfo
```

## Monitoring

Floresta also (optionally) provides [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics endpoint, which you can enable at compile time. If you want a quick setup with Grafana, we provide a [docker-compose.yml](../contrib/docker/docker-compose.yml) for that as well. Just use:

```bash
docker compose -f contrib/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

This will start Floresta on Bitcoin mainnet by default. All blockchain data, metrics, and Grafana configurations are persisted in Docker volumes.

## Running on Different Networks

The provided `docker-compose.yml` supports running Floresta on different Bitcoin networks. To make this easy and avoid port collisions, we provide a sample environment file.

Copy the sample file from `contrib/docker/env.docker.sample`:

```bash
cp contrib/docker/env.docker.sample .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to uncomment the network you want to use (which sets the correct NETWORK, RPC_PORT, and ELECTRUM_PORT), and then run:

```bash
docker compose -f contrib/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Alternatively, you can pass the variables directly inline:

```bash
NETWORK=signet RPC_PORT=38332 ELECTRUM_PORT=60001 docker compose -f contrib/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## Using Local Floresta Data

If you already have a florestad datadir on your machine (e.g., from a previous run), you can reuse that datadir instead of starting from scratch:

```bash
# Use your existing ~/.floresta directory
FLORESTA_DATA=$HOME/.floresta docker compose -f contrib/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

You can also uncomment and set the FLORESTA_DATA variable directly inside your `.env` file:

```yml
FLORESTA_DATA=$HOME/.floresta
```
