Floresta is a lightweight and embeddable Bitcoin client designed for users and applications that
want strong validation guarantees without the operational overhead of traditional full nodes.

It can be run as a standalone fully validating node or embedded as a library, allowing developers
to reuse the same client components across different applications and deployments.

## Name

Floresta is the Portuguese word for forest. It is a reference to the Utreexo accumulator,
which is a forest of Merkle trees. It's pronounced _/floˈɾɛstɐ/_.

## Architecture

Floresta is written in Rust and implements modern Bitcoin validation techniques such as
[Utreexo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/611),
[PoW Fraud Proofs](https://blog.dlsouza.lol/2023/09/28/pow-fraud-proof.html), and pruning,
to significantly reduce resource requirements while preserving trust and security.

Floresta is composed of two main components: `libfloresta` and `florestad`.

[`libfloresta`](https://github.com/getfloresta/Floresta/tree/master/crates) is a collection of
reusable components that can be integrated into Bitcoin applications.
[`florestad`](https://github.com/getfloresta/Floresta/tree/master/bin/florestad) builds on top of
[`libfloresta`](https://github.com/getfloresta/Floresta/tree/master/crates) to provide a full node
daemon, including a watch-only wallet and an Electrum server.

If you only want to run a node, you can use
[`florestad`](https://github.com/getfloresta/Floresta/tree/master/bin/florestad) by building it from
source, following the instructions for [Unix](doc/build-unix.md) or [MacOS](doc/build-macos.md).

## Consensus Implementation

One of the most challenging parts of working with Bitcoin is keeping up with the consensus rules.
Given its nature as a consensus protocol, it's very important to make sure that the implementation
is correct and on par with Bitcoin Core. Instead of reimplementing a Bitcoin Script interpreter,
we use [`rust-bitcoinkernel`](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/rust-bitcoinkernel/), which is a
wrapper around [`libbitcoinkernel`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303),
a C++ library that exposes Bitcoin Core's validation engine. It allows validating blocks,
transaction outputs and reading block data with the same API as Bitcoin Core.

## Developing

Detailed documentation for [`libfloresta`](https://github.com/getfloresta/Floresta/tree/master/crates)
is available [here](https://docs.getfloresta.sh/floresta/). Additionally, the
[floresta-docs](https://getfloresta.github.io/floresta-docs/) `mdBook` provides an
in-depth look at the libraries' architecture and internals.

Further information can be found in the [documentation folder](/doc).
