//! The node interface definition trait.
//!
//! Our node runs as a task that owns it and manages all its state internally. It processes data as
//! it arrives, updates our local state, and makes sure we keep doing progress. This architecture
//! is very nice because it requires minimal synchronization, provides near-perfect encapsulation,
//! improves testing and makes debug easier. The only problem is: if you are not allowed to own or
//! share the node, how do you communicate with it?
//!
//! The answer is: The node handle! You can get one by calling `get_handle`, and use it to send and
//! receive messages to/from the node. You can use it request blocks, transactions, cfilters,
//! proofs, ask the node to connect with someone, ask the node to disconnect from some peer, etc.
//!
//! This module defines the common interface used by the node handle, the actual implementation is
//! under `node_handle.rs`. We do this to make our testing easier, since we can mock a node while
//! testing other modules, and to allow people to reuse other crates without wire: simply
//! re-implement the relevant parts of node interface and you are fine!
